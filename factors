"""
Factorize numbers into a product of two smaller numbers.

Usage: factors <file>
where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
One number per line.
You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1.
You can assume that there will be no empty line, and no space before and after the valid number.
The file will always end with a new line.
Output format: n=p*q
One factorization per line.
p and q donâ€™t have to be prime numbers.
